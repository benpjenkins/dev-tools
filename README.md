# @bjenk/dev-tools

A monorepo managed by Lerna containing several packages in development to be used in future projects.  Planned/In Development packages include.

- React Component Library with Styled Components
- Custom React Hooks Library
- Above integrated into Storybook for demonstration and documentation
- Published ESLint config.
- CLI for initializing different types of projects with dependencies from this repo already installed (probably more features down the line).

Once a 1.0 release is finalized READMEs will be updated and documentation/implementation guides will be added.

Planned work includes feature development, unit test coverage, publishing strategies (such as generated change logs, automated version incrementing)
